### Naming and Tagging Images
Docker made easy tutorial
Docker Tag is a label assigned to a Docker image that allows users to identify and manage the image effectively. 
The Docker Tag Command creates a new tag for a Docker image. 
By default, Docker will use the latest tag if none is specified, and it's possible to create multiple tags for a single image.
Choosing a clear and descriptive name for your Docker images is important to help make them easy to understand and manage.

 The syntax for the Docker tag command is as follows: 
# docker tag IMAGE_ID REPOSITORY: TAG

# USE CASES
Docker tags are used to identify specific versions or variants of Docker images. 
They can be used in many different ways, including:
Version control: Docker tags can be used to track the version history of an image and roll back to a previous version if necessary.
Environment separation: Different tags can be used to identify images that are intended for use in different environments, such as development, staging, and production.
Collaboration: Docker tags can be used to share images with other developers or deploy them to a registry for use in continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.

To explicitly tag an image in Docker, you can use the docker tag command. This command allows you to create a new tag for an existing image in your local Docker image repository.
# Syntax:  docker tag <image> <repository>:<tag>
